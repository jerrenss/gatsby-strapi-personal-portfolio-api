## Personal Portfolio with Gatsby and Strapi

Credits to [John Smilga](https://www.johnsmilga.com/), and his tutorial which can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc_ITwxiG-Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc_ITwxiG-Y). Managed to learn a lot about the Gatsby JS and Strapi JS framework. Highly recommended to those looking to create a clean, attractive portfolio site!
